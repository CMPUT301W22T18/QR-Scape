QR-Scape allows us to hunt for the coolest QR codes that score the most points, in real time! Players will run around scanning QR codes, barcodes, etc. trying to find those which give them the most points. Users can then upload and share images, locations, and descriptions of their QR codes. 

A community-wide map of the locations of all QR codes is also available, so users can hunt down the nearest ones. Of course, users can also decline to share the location of any of their QR codes. 

There is a community-wide leaderboard that users can track in real-time - watch as you climb the leaderboard with every new code!
