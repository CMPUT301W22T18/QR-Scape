QR-Scape is a Pokemon-Go clone that allows us to hunt for the highest-scoring, coolest QR codes, in real time! Players will run around scanning QR codes, barcodes, etc. trying to find those which give them the most points. Users can then upload and share images, locations, and descriptions of their QR codes. 

A community-wide map of the locations of all QR codes is also available, so users can hunt down the nearest ones. Of course, users can also decline to share the location of any of their QR codes. Along with the map, users can see the associated images for each QR code (as long as the original uploader decided to upload one).

There is a community-wide leaderboard that users can track in real-time - watch as you climb the leaderboard with every new code! Want to see what QR codes the #1 player has scanned? No problem, QR Scape users have customizable profiles where they can show off their highest-scoring QR codes.
